# Frontend Development Constraints

## Hard Rules

- For every frontend change: do not change the code in `main` or `cli`.
- Never suggest changing `main` or `cli`.
- Never use dummy data in the UI.
- Only use real raw data and real configs.

These constraints must be followed for all future modifications to this project.
